JOINTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internally all joins are based on nested for loop

all data is not stored in one table data is stored in multile table 
if you want to see the column of 2 tables then you have to write a joint

The postion of column in SELECT clause will determine the postion of col  in output WHERE clause can be written in any sequence

In order for the join to work faster,preferably the driving table shuld be table with leasse number of rows

dept <--- driving table
emp4 <--- driven table

Faster processing when driving table is size is smaller

(fast)
SELECT ename , dname
FROM   emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;

(slow)
emp4 <--- driving table
dept <--- driven table
SELECT ename , dname
FROM   dept,emp4
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;

+--------+-------+
| ename  | dname |
+--------+-------+
| ARUN   | TRN   |
| ALI    | TRN   |
| Kiran  | TRN   |
| JACK   | EXP   |
| THOMAS | EXP   |
| Nidhi  | TRN   |

The common column in both the tables is deptno,the common column that is present in both the table the column name need not be the same in both the tables, because the same column may have a different meaning in the other table

SELECT ename , dname
FROM   dept,emp4
WHERE dept.x = emp4.y;

the datatype of common column in both the table should be the same & there has to be some logical reason on whose basis you are writing the join
SELECT ename , dname
FROM   dept,emp4
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.empno;

To make the output more presentatble :-
SELECT dname,ename from emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;


It's good to dispaly lots of column in the output, it become richer and more meaningful
SELECT dname,loc,ename,job,sal from emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;
	
Column ambiguously define(if the common column had different columnname is both table then this proble would not have arisen)
		(*)	
SELECT deptno,dname,loc,ename,job,sal from emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;


Its a googd programming pratice to user tablename.columnname for all the column, because it make the SELECT state
SELECT dept.deptno,dept.dname,dept.loc,emp4.ename,emp4.ejob,emp4.esal from emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;

or 

SELECT emp.deptno,dept.dname,dept.loc,emp4.ename,emp4.ejob,emp4.esal from emp4,dept
WHERE dept.deptno = emp4.deptno;
