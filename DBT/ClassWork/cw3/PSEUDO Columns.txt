PSEUDO Columns
* Fake columns (Virtual columns)
* it's not a column of the table , but you can use it in SELECT statement

eg
a)Computed column (Annual =  sal * 12)
b) Expressions (Net_earnings = sal + comm -tax)
c) Function-based column AVG_sal = AVG(sal), R_sal=round(sal,-3)

RDBMS suplied PSEUDO columns :-

SELECT rowid,ename,sal FROM emp4;

SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY empno) AS RowID,
    ename,
    sal
FROM
    emp4;

rowid is a PSEUDO column, it stand for ROW identfier.
ROWID is the actuall physical memory location in the DB server hd where that row is located
IT will always be in ascending order of ROWID
ROWID is not a column of the table but you can use it in SELECT statement
WHEN you SELECT from a table , the order of rows in the output depends on the row address; it will always be in ascending order of rowid
ROWID is a fixed -length encrypted string of 18 characters
When you UPDATE a row if the row length is decrasing the the address (rowid ) is will not change
When you UPDATE a row, if thre row length is increasing & if free space is not avaible then the address will change
No two row of any table in entire  DB server  HD CAN HAVE SAME ROWID/;.
rowid work as unique identifirer froir emp


USE :: you can use rowid to UPDATE or DELETE the duplicate row
a)ROW locking
b)to make indexes
c)to mange the cusors
d)row id work as unqiue identfier to distingiush between two rows
e)row managment

rowid iwork as an unique identfier for every row in the database
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() rowid, ename, sal
FROM emp4;
