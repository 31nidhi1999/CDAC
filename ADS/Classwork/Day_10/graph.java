Graph ::  A grap is a non linear DS composed of 2 components
1)Vertices :: (Node) -> Enitity/object
2)Edges - > connected pai of vertices

G=(V,E)
V= vertices of graph
E= edges of graph


Types of edges
1)Undirected edges  u--->v
				 souredesmm
2)Directed edges   u---v

Unideirection graph

No of edges ::  Undirected grapthe no of

since the rdge (V,V)edhe edge)UY)
tje np of edge in an unidrection graph is n(n-1)/2


No of edges in directed graph

 The no of edges in direct grap <=n*(n-1);
 
 
 
 Type of grap
 =================
 1)Trival :: graph with one vertex O
 2) Null graph :: multiple graph without connection O O O O 
 3)Disconneted graph :: atleast one node is not reachable
 O--O
 
 O--0
 4)Connected graph :: every node is reachble or CLCYE grap(where all vertices for cycle)
